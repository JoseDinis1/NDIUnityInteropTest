This repository was used to test the idea of using C# interoperability to implement a Unity NDI plugin without C++ code.
The finalized code has been successfully merged to the NDI plugin ([KlakNDI]).

This repository is left for archival purposes and further interop tests.
If you're looking for a NDI solution, please check the [KlakNDI] repository.
